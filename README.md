# Housing_Prices_Analysis-IPWK7_machine_learning
## Introduction
The project undertaken involved analysis of a housing dataset. The records detailed the characteristics of houses and their market prices in 2015. The analysis involved investigating the factors that influenced the prices for the houses. The raw dataset had 21613 rows and 20 columns .The following were the columns in the dataset:
- id ---> the house id
- price ---> market price of the house
- bedrooms ---> number of bedrooms
- bathrooms ---> number of bathrooms
- sqft_living ---> the area in square feet of the living area
- sqft_lot ---> the area in square feet of the parking layout
- floors ---> number of floors
- waterfront ---> whether there is waterfront or not
- view ---> number of views
- condition ---> the condition of the house
- grade ---> the assigned grade for the house
- sqft_above
- sqft_basement ---> the area in square feet of the basement
- yr_built ---> the year the house was built
- yr_renovated ---> year the house was renovated
- zip_code ---> zip code of the area
- lat ---> latitude
- long ---> longitude
- sqft_living15 ---> area in square feet of the living area in 2015
- sqft_lot15 ---> area in square feet of the parking layout in 2015
## Summary of Analysis
The procedure of analysis was as follows:
- Importing relevant libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Previewing of the data
- Data cleaning procedures
- EDA: Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis
- Implementing the solution: building a linear and quantile regression model
- Challenging the solution: building models for prediction using Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net regression
## Technologies used
The analysis was undertaken in a jupyter notebook
## Setup
The code can be run on any software that reads python language
